Let's take a look at another dataset.

```{r}
?MASS::Cars93
cars = MASS::Cars93
cars
```

Usually, we are trying to build a model for `Price`. Let's see how `Horsepower` is related to price:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
ggplot(cars, aes(Horsepower, Price)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```


```{r}
simple_linear_model = lm(Price ~ Horsepower, data = cars)
coef(simple_linear_model)
summary(simple_linear_model)$r.squared
summary(simple_linear_model)$sigma
```

62\% is pretty good $R^2$! But the RMSE is about \$6,000. Using the empirical rule heuristic, that means you can only predict within $\pm \$12,000$ around 95\% of the time. Not so good!

# Predictions with linear models in R

After the model is fit, you may want to predict with it using the $g$ function. Of course R can do this:

```{r}
predict(simple_linear_model, data.frame(Horsepower = 200)) #i.e. g(400)
predict(simple_linear_model, data.frame(Horsepower = c(200, 300, 500))) #i.e. g(200), g(300), g(500)
```

##Simple regression with nominal variables

Let's take a look at the factor variable as the predictor. We'll use `Origin` in this example:

```{r}
table(cars$Origin)
```

We can plot how this looks:

```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(Origin, Price)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

Note that ggplot cannot handle fitting a line with a factor variable.

However...

```{r}
simple_linear_model = lm(Price ~ Origin, data = cars)
coef(simple_linear_model)
summary(simple_linear_model)$r.squared
summary(simple_linear_model)$sigma
```

What happened here? The `lm` function can handle factors. It picks a level to be the reference category (in this case, it's origin = USA) and the fitted slope $b_1$ would be the difference between non-USA and USA. Does it make sense that the slope is positive? Yes - foreign cars charge transport fees and there are a lot of luxury foreign cars.

Why is $R^2$ so low?? Remember the null model is one $\bar{y}$, this model is just two $\bar{y}$'s. How much variance can you possible expect to explain with just two possible prediction values?? Now take a look at RMSE. It's about \$10,000. Before, it was about \$6,000 and the $R^2$ = 62\%. Yes the RMSE has gone up in this case. $R^2$ is not proportion standard error explained, it's proportion variance and that squared error is very different than its square root.

Let's cast this predict as numeric and run it again just to make sure it will be the same. We first code a new dummy variable:

```{r}
cars$origin_is_not_usa = ifelse(cars$Origin == "non-USA", 1, 0)
```

and then we model using this new dummy variable:

```{r}
simple_linear_model = lm(Price ~ origin_is_not_usa, data = cars)
coef(simple_linear_model)
summary(simple_linear_model)$r.squared
summary(simple_linear_model)$sigma
```

Note the reference category is USA and the "non-USA" coefficient indicates the difference in sample averages.

Note that now ggplot can handle the line:

```{r}
ggplot(cars, aes(origin_is_not_usa, Price)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

Let's code the dummy variable differently to take a look at the equivalent regression but this time with the reference category as non-USA

```{r}
cars$origin_is_usa = ifelse(cars$Origin == "USA", 1, 0)
```

```{r}
simple_linear_model = lm(Price ~ origin_is_usa, data = cars)
coef(simple_linear_model)
summary(simple_linear_model)$r.squared
summary(simple_linear_model)$sigma
```

The coefficients here are like "the opposite" in some sense of what we just saw. 

And of course $R^2$ and RMSE are equivalent - it's the same linear model with the same information, just coded differently.

What is the intercept is left out? You can remove the intercept from the formula by adding "0 + ..." which means "no intercept but ..."

```{r}
simple_linear_model = lm(Price ~ 0 + Origin, data = cars)
coef(simple_linear_model)
summary(simple_linear_model)$r.squared
summary(simple_linear_model)$sigma
```

What did $R^2$ seem like it changed?? The `lm` method is calculating $R^2$ differently here if there is no intercept. The null model it is comparing to is $g_0 = 0$ and not our $g_0 = \bar{y}$. This is a small point about the implementation in R and I won't ever test you on this trivia.

Let's do an example of a categorical nominal variable with L>2 levels.

```{r}
summary(cars)
table(cars$Type)
mean(cars[cars$Type == "Compact", "Price"])
mean(cars[cars$Type == "Large",   "Price"])
mean(cars[cars$Type == "Midsize", "Price"])
mean(cars[cars$Type == "Small",   "Price"])
mean(cars[cars$Type == "Sporty",  "Price"])
mean(cars[cars$Type == "Van",     "Price"])
lm(Price ~ 0 + Type, cars)
lm(Price ~ Type, cars)
```

What is the reference level in this variable? Can we change it?

```{r}
levels(cars$Type)
cars$Type = relevel(cars$Type, ref = "Van")
lm(Price ~ Type, cars)
lm(Price ~ 0 + Type, cars)
```


## Correlation and Covariance

Let's load up the Boston Housing data again.

```{r}
boston = MASS::Boston
str(boston)
```

Let us take a look at some covariances and correlations with the response, the median home value.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)
cov(boston$rm, boston$medv)
cor(boston$rm, boston$medv)
ggplot(boston, aes(rm, medv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
cov(boston$indus, boston$medv)
cor(boston$indus, boston$medv)
ggplot(boston, aes(indus, medv)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm')
```

Ever wonder why it's called $R^2$?

```{r}
summary(lm(medv ~ rm, boston))$r.squared
cor(boston$rm, boston$medv)^2
summary(lm(medv ~ indus, boston))$r.squared
cor(boston$indus, boston$medv)^2
```

## Multivariate linear regression

We want to run a multivariate linear regression $\mathcal{H}$ employing the least squares $\mathcal{A}$ manually using our derived linear algebra. Let us first pull out $\mathbb{D}$ as $y$ and $X$.

Let's ensure we augment the `X` to include the 1 vector in front. We need this for the intercept in the $w$ vector in our spec, $\mathcal{H}$.

```{r}
y = MASS::Boston$medv
X = cbind(1, MASS::Boston[, 1 : 13])
head(X)
```

Can we find $X^\top X$?

```{r}
XtX = t(X) %*% X
```

The data frame is great, but unfortunately R does not allow us to use matrix algebra on it.

So let's create a matrix. Note: there are no factor variables with more than one level. `chas` is a binary variable and that's okay. If there were factors with more than level, the following will not work. We will explore this later.

```{r}
X = as.matrix(cbind(1, MASS::Boston[, 1 : 13]))
head(X)
```

So $p = 12$ and $p + 1 = 14$.

Let's make each predictor name nice just for aesthetic value:

```{r}
colnames(X)
colnames(X)[1] = "(intercept)" #this is the standard way lm denotes it (which we will compare to later)
colnames(X)
```


Can we find $X^\top X$?

```{r}
XtX = t(X) %*% X
dim(XtX)
```

Is it full rank?

```{r}
XtXinv = solve(XtX)
```

It worked. This means $X$ is full rank i.e. there is no linear duplication of information over the `13 + 1` predictors. In case we're in doubt:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(Matrix)
rankMatrix(X)[[1]]
rankMatrix(t(X))[[1]]
rankMatrix(XtX)[[1]]
rankMatrix(XtXinv)[[1]]
```


Let's calculate the LS solution then:

```{r}
b = XtXinv %*% t(X) %*% y
b
```

Interpretation: if `crim` "increases" by 1, $\hat{y}$ increases by... etc etc. How would `crim` increase? Big philosophical topic which we are punting on (for now). If all predictors are 0, then $y$ would be predicted to be the intercept, 20.65. Strange concept... not usually important.

What would $g$ look like?

```{r}
g_predict_function = function(x_star){
   x_star %*% b
}
g_predict_function(X[7, ])
y[7] #good prediction!
```

Pretty simple...  and `x_star` could be a matrix of `n_star * (p + 1)` - where `n_star` is however many new observations you wish to predict.

We can compute all predictions:

```{r}
yhat = X %*% b
head(yhat, 10)
```

Can you tell this is projected onto a 14 dimensionsal space from a 506 dimensional space? Not really... but it is...

We can calculate the residuals:

```{r}
e = y - yhat
head(e, 10)
```

What is RMSE?

```{r}
SSE = t(e) %*% e
MSE = 1 / (nrow(X) - ncol(X)) * SSE
RMSE = sqrt(MSE)
SSE
MSE
RMSE
```

Interpret the RMSE...

We can calculate $R^2$ two ways:

```{r}
s_sq_y = var(y)
s_sq_e = var(e)
Rsq = (s_sq_y - s_sq_e) / s_sq_y
Rsq

n = length(e)
SST = (n - 1) * s_sq_y
Rsq = 1 - SSE / SST
Rsq
```

Let's look at distribution of $y$ and $e$ to get an idea about $R^2$ as we did before:


```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggplot2)

ggplot(data.frame(null_residuals = y - mean(y), residuals = e)) + 
  stat_density(aes(x = residuals), fill = "darkgreen", alpha = 0.3) + 
  stat_density(aes(x = null_residuals, fill = "red", alpha = 0.3)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

What does this tell you about $R^2$?

Now, of course, R has its own function to do all this. We've already seen them! To run a multivariate least squares linear model,

```{r}
mult_lin_mod = lm(medv ~ ., MASS::Boston)
```

No need to (a) create a matrix from the data frame (b) append a 1's column (c) do the linear algebra. It's all done for you. What is this formula `medv ~ .`? Previously we've seen `medv ~ rm` to indicate "fit phenomenon `medv` using predictor `rm`". Here, it's "fit phenomenon `medv` using all available predictors in the data frame". This is a very powerful formula!

Let's extract the estimates $b$ as well as $R^2$ and RMSE:

```{r}
coef(mult_lin_mod)
summary(mult_lin_mod)$r.squared
summary(mult_lin_mod)$sigma
```

Does R offer a simple way to do $g$? Sure...

```{r}
x_star = MASS::Boston[7, ]
y_hat_star = predict(mult_lin_mod, newdata = x_star)
y_hat_star
y[7]
```

If you care about the internals of what R is doing, it retraces our steps perfectly. It first creates the "model matrix" we called the "design matrix" and denoted it X:

```{r}
Xmm = model.matrix(medv ~ ., MASS::Boston)
head(Xmm)
head(X) #same
```

Then it uses an internal function to compute the linear algebra:

```{r}
raw_mod = lm.fit(Xmm, y)
raw_mod$coefficients
```

We will soon see the internals of the `lm.fit` algorithm when we do the linear algebra of QR decomposition.
