#An Example of Correlation without Causation

When does correlation really not imply causation? We now mean real correlation, not spurious correlation. This correlation will persist as the sample size increases. 

From class, we spoke about the phenomenon $y$ = "num car accidents" with observed feature "x" = "num umbrellas sold" but common cause $z$ = "rain amount". It is clear the umbrella sales has *no causal* relationship with car accidents. But they *are correlated* because they are linked by a common cause. Here's the data example that makes this clear.

The data generating process as specified by the causal diagram looks as follows:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
set.seed(1)
n = 300
sigma = 0.3

umbrella_example_data = data.frame(
  z_rainfall = runif(n, 0, 6) #here's the common cause - rainfall
)
umbrella_example_data$x_umbrella_sales = umbrella_example_data$z_rainfall^2 + rnorm(n, sigma) #x is a variable that is driven by z with noise
umbrella_example_data$y_car_accidents = umbrella_example_data$z_rainfall + rnorm(n, sigma) #y is a variable driven by z with noise
```

So we only see $x$ and $y$. Here's what it appears as:

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, data.table, magrittr)
ggplot(umbrella_example_data) +
  aes(x = x_umbrella_sales, y = y_car_accidents) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

and the model looks like:

```{r}
mod = lm(y_car_accidents ~ x_umbrella_sales, umbrella_example_data)
summary(mod)
```

So what's the interpretation of the coefficient for $x$? ...

What you can't say is that $x$ is a causal contributor to $y$! You may want to say it, but you can't!

Now let's build a model of $y$ linear in both $x$ and $z$. What happens?

```{r}
mod = lm(y_car_accidents ~ x_umbrella_sales + z_rainfall, umbrella_example_data)
summary(mod)
```

The effect of $x$ is gone!! Why? If you keep $z$ constant, the sole true causal factor in $y$, manipulating $x$ won't matter anymore!

Why is this? Well, you can look at how x affects y in local areas of z for instance.

```{r}
b = 0.8; a = 0.7
z_small_indices = umbrella_example_data$z_rainfall < 
  quantile(umbrella_example_data$z_rainfall, b) &
  umbrella_example_data$z_rainfall >
  quantile(umbrella_example_data$z_rainfall, a)

local_plot = ggplot(umbrella_example_data[z_small_indices, ]) +
  aes(x = x_umbrella_sales, y = y_car_accidents) +
  geom_point()
local_plot
local_plot +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

If you force the common cause (lurking variable) to be an approximate constant, then you won't see any affect of x on y.

# Asymmetric Cost Models in Trees and RF

Let's load up the adult dataset where the response is 1 if the person makes more than $50K per year and 0 if they make less than $50K per year.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
options(java.parameters = "-Xmx4000m")
pacman::p_load(YARF)
pacman::p_load_gh("coatless/ucidata")
data(adult)
adult %<>% 
  na.omit #kill any observations with missingness
```

Let's use samples of 2,000 to run experiments:

```{r}
train_size = 2000
train_indices = sample(1 : nrow(adult), train_size)
adult_train = adult[train_indices, ]
y_train = adult_train$income
X_train = adult_train %>% select(-income)
test_indices = setdiff(1 : nrow(adult), train_indices)
adult_test = adult[test_indices, ]
y_test = adult_test$income
X_test = adult_test %>% select(-income)
```

What does the $y$'s look like?

```{r}
table(y_train)
```

Very imbalanced. This would off-the-bat make y=0 the default.

Now make a regular RF and look at the oob confusion table and FDR and FOR:

```{r}
num_trees = 500
yarf_mod = YARF(X_train, y_train, num_trees = num_trees, calculate_oob_error = FALSE)
y_hat_test = predict(yarf_mod, X_test)
oos_confusion = table(y_test, y_hat_test)
oos_confusion
cat("FDR =", oos_confusion[1, 2] / sum(oos_confusion[, 2]), "\n")
cat("FOR =", oos_confusion[2, 1] / sum(oos_confusion[, 1]), "\n")
```

High FDR rate and low FOR rate. Let's try to change this and reduce the FDR by oversampling 0's.

```{r}
idx_0 = which(y_train == "<=50K")
n_0 = length(idx_0)
idx_1 = which(y_train == ">50K")
n_1 = length(idx_1)

bootstrap_indices = list()
for (m in 1 : num_trees){
  bootstrap_indices[[m]] = c( #note n_0' + n_1' doesn't equal n. You can make it so with one more line of code...
    sample(idx_0, round(2.0 * n_0), replace = TRUE),
    sample(idx_1, round(0.5 * n_1), replace = TRUE)
  )
}
yarf_mod_asymmetric = YARF(X_train, y_train, bootstrap_indices = bootstrap_indices, calculate_oob_error = FALSE)
y_hat_test = predict(yarf_mod_asymmetric, X_test)
oos_confusion = table(y_test, y_hat_test)
oos_confusion
cat("FDR =", oos_confusion[1, 2] / sum(oos_confusion[, 2]), "\n")
cat("FOR =", oos_confusion[2, 1] / sum(oos_confusion[, 1]), "\n")
```

You can even vary the sampling and trace out ROC / DET curves. See function `YARFROC`.

# Boosting?

Nice simple explanation: https://towardsdatascience.com/basic-ensemble-learning-random-forest-adaboost-gradient-boosting-step-by-step-explained-95d49d1e2725

```{r}
pacman::p_load(xgboost)
```

Look at performance on adult dataset. This demo isn't working yet.

```{r}
xgboost_mod = xgboost(data = data.matrix(X_train), 
 label = as.numeric(y_train == ">50K"), 
 num_class = 2, #y = 0 or 1
 eta = 0.3, #default
 max_depth = 6, #default 
 nrounds = 25, 
 subsample = 1, #default 
 colsample_bytree = 1,
 eval_metric = "merror",
 objective = "multi:softmax",
 nthread = 3
)

y_hat_test = as.numeric(predict(xgboost_mod, data.matrix(X_test)))
oos_confusion = table(y_test, ifelse(y_hat_test == 0, "<=50K", ">50K"))
oos_confusion
cat("FDR =", oos_confusion[1, 2] / sum(oos_confusion[, 2]), "\n")
cat("FOR =", oos_confusion[2, 1] / sum(oos_confusion[, 1]), "\n")
```

Invert train and test splits and let it train on 28,000 observations.

```{r}
xgboost_mod = xgboost(data = data.matrix(X_test), 
 label = as.numeric(y_test == ">50K"), 
 num_class = 2, #y = 0 or 1
 eta = 0.5, #default
 max_depth = 6, #default 
 nrounds = 50, 
 subsample = 1, #default 
 colsample_bytree = 1,
 eval_metric = "merror",
 objective = "multi:softmax",
 nthread = 3
)

y_hat_test = as.numeric(predict(xgboost_mod, data.matrix(X_train)))
oos_confusion = table(y_train, ifelse(y_hat_test == 0, "<=50K", ">50K"))
oos_confusion
cat("FDR =", oos_confusion[1, 2] / sum(oos_confusion[, 2]), "\n")
cat("FOR =", oos_confusion[2, 1] / sum(oos_confusion[, 1]), "\n")
```

Lightning fast on $n = 30000$!!! But only a bit more accurate. This leads me to think the error is mostly in delta.

We can try playing with the hyperparams. A lot to CV over! You think this is a lot... wait until you see deep learning networks!
